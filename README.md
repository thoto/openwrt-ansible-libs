# openwrt-ansible-libs
Ansible libraries written in lua for use with OpenWRT

The reason of these modules is to use ansible to manage an OpenWRT router
without installing python or using the raw module.

Be careful and do not be afraid to patch things. This is my first lua code
so do not expect to see any kind of "good code".

The setup-openwrt module is aimed to be a clone of the python setup module
included in the ansible core modules but written in lua.
